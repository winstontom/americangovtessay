Lake Butler City Council
<br>	For a required assignment in my American Government class I went to a city council 
<br>meeting. I witnessed and learned a lot of stuff at this meeting. They talked mostly about the 
<br>water lines and water reworks. Also how they want to make Lake Butler and its citizens a better 
<br>place. And lastly they talked about how they wanted to clean up Lake Butler. Lake Butler has to 
<br>do lots of planning.	
<br>	First off, they talked about the water projects in Lake Butler. Firstly, they got 
<br>compensated from ComCast for bursting a water pipe while giving them $5,000. Also they are	
<br>purchasing a 22 chevy silverado utility truck mostly for water works that will cost them under 	
<br>$50K. And lastly they were approved for $55M to start the wastewater plan in 2033. This was a	
<br>big part of the meeting; more than half of the talking was about water.	
<br>	Secondly, they were discussing the performance of the city. First they said they got a
<br>performance evaluation of 4.8 out of 5; which is really good. Also they are preparing for the city	
<br>election and said they would save $4-5K if no one ran against her; the person has to be a member 	
<br>of the city for 6 months. Lastly they were awarded the ‘Distinguished Budget Award,’ they were	
<br>awarded by 3 anonymous individuals that said we are doing well. This sounds really good for	
<br>Lake Butler.
<br>	Third and lastly, they want to make Lake Butler look cleaner for future and current
<br>citizens. Firstly they said they are introducing a program called “Bright Idea,” which would	
<br>allow for employees that have an idea to save money; if they are successful they will get the 	
<br>percentage saved. Secondly they mentioned a second boat race in the fall which does a lot for 	
<br>commissioners and helps give back to the community. And lastly they were talking about new 	
<br>shops coming which are ‘O’Reilly, Dunkin’ Donuts, a gas station and a possible pizza place; also 	
<br>they said they were asking to have shops clean up their storefronts to make the city look better.
<br>	To conclude, Lake Butler has been doing lots of planning. They have a lot of water
<br>problems to solve. They also have very good city performance. And finally they are giving back	
<br>to the community. Do you agree or disagree with anything that the districts are doing?
