Lake Butler City Council
	For a required assignment in my American Government class I went to a city council 
meeting. I witnessed and learned a lot of stuff at this meeting. They talked mostly about the 
water lines and water reworks. Also how they want to make Lake Butler and its citizens a better 
place. And lastly they talked about how they wanted to clean up Lake Butler. Lake Butler has to 
do lots of planning.	
	First off, they talked about the water projects in Lake Butler. Firstly, they got 
compensated from ComCast for bursting a water pipe while giving them $5,000. Also they are	
purchasing a 22 chevy silverado utility truck mostly for water works that will cost them under 	
$50K. And lastly they were approved for $55M to start the wastewater plan in 2033. This was a	
big part of the meeting; more than half of the talking was about water.	
	Secondly, they were discussing the performance of the city. First they said they got a
performance evaluation of 4.8 out of 5; which is really good. Also they are preparing for the city	
election and said they would save $4-5K if no one ran against her; the person has to be a member 	
of the city for 6 months. Lastly they were awarded the ‘Distinguished Budget Award,’ they were	
awarded by 3 anonymous individuals that said we are doing well. This sounds really good for	
Lake Butler.
	Third and lastly, they want to make Lake Butler look cleaner for future and current
citizens. Firstly they said they are introducing a program called “Bright Idea,” which would	
allow for employees that have an idea to save money; if they are successful they will get the 	
percentage saved. Secondly they mentioned a second boat race in the fall which does a lot for 	
commissioners and helps give back to the community. And lastly they were talking about new 	
shops coming which are ‘O’Reilly, Dunkin’ Donuts, a gas station and a possible pizza place; also 	
they said they were asking to have shops clean up their storefronts to make the city look better.
	To conclude, Lake Butler has been doing lots of planning. They have a lot of water
problems to solve. They also have very good city performance. And finally they are giving back	
to the community. Do you agree or disagree with anything that the districts are doing?
